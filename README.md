# Goal
this is the first time I put myself in a time limit to build something, the idea behind this is that I practice finishing games instead of only programming them.

# Time
3 Hours in total
- 2 hours - exluding the Music and fixing up the spritehseet format by hand
- 1 hour - only had movement and was busy designing the map

# Unnecessary Lore
you wake up, not remembering where you are or who you are. You try to explore your environment in the hope to find someone who might give you a clue, and help you to get back home.
The player committed suicide and hasn't reached heaven or hell, but just a different world. One that made him realize life was worth living in the first place.
